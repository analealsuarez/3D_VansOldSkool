# 3D_VansOldSkool
This is a repository of a 3D modeled Vans Old Skool made with Blender. I subdivided it into the Blender files, where you can get the *simple model*, a *turnaround animation*, *pair of Vans* and into extras such as *fbx and obj-file*.


The Blender files are too large, so I had to split them up. Just download the files and open the first file.

- **vans_grey_right.blend.7z.001 -  vans_grey_right.blend.7z.008** = simple model

- **vans_turnaround.blend.7z.001 - vans_turnaround.blend.7z.007** = turnaround animation

- **vans_black_pair.blend.7z.001 - vans_black_pair.blend.7z.007** = pair of Vans

- **vans.fbx.7z.001 - vans.fbx.7z.007** = fbx file
